# Marine Management Take Homes Test

Rails Server + PostgreSQL database back-end and React JS front-end Marine Management web-app.

It connects to the Rails Server to display available boats with its respective dock number, name, length, and color in a table. A user can:
* Add a boat
* Move or change the dock of a boat
* Delete a boat

In order to run locally user need to the following:

* Clone locally
* Configure PG server locally from database.yml file
* Install bundle install and dependent gems
* npm and yarn install for JS dependencies 
* Run "rails s"

# What I learned?

I learned to combine rails and react by creating a rails app with webpack enabled by including --webpack=react flag. Learned to create routes. Reaffirmed my knowledge in making axios API calls, and writing asynchronous code in React JS. 

# What I can do better if I had time?

I would have definitely implemented a drag and drop function instead of buttons to make changes in the dock position of a boat.
